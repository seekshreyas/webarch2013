HW1 : _Experience & Browsers_
=================================


## Your experience with web architecture. Have you written HTML before? Written Javascript?

- Before coming to school, I worked as an interaction designer where a part of my responsibilities was front-end prototyping and web development.
- I sometimes helped out with back-end implementation but it was not my key responsibility and did only to troubleshoot or help a colleague. 
- During a summer in my undergrad I got the `CCNA` certification, but it might have been a long time ago. 

## What are your favorite features from at least 2 browsers?

- Chrome:
    - __Sandboxed Environment__:
        - when a tab stops responding, then only the tab crashes not the entire browser application (as I suspect the browser is multi-threaded). It used to be a nightmare with earlier browsers when 1 tab could crash the entire browser and I would end up losing my entire session.
    - __Session Sync__:
        - Earlier it could be established only via 3rd party add-ons like `XMarks` but Chrome by default had session/tabs/bookmarks/extesions/preferences sync across all platforms.
- Lynx
    - __Text-based browser on Command line__:
        - It allowed me to check cricket scores from command line and people looking over my shoulder at work place to think that I was _actually_ working :). Couldn't have made it without this browser through the `2011 Cricket World Cup`.
